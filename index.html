<h6> Visual Studio Code is a coding platform that people can use to make websites. The way you can setup your Visual
    Studio Code app is that you can start a new folder on your desktop or use an existing folder. Once you have done
    that just open the file in Visual Studio Code, and you will be ready to start your coding adventure.</h6>

<h6>The console screen is a place where the some information gets logged. it is useful to view something that you coded
    on the website without necessarily seeing it directly right on the web page. The way you can open the console screen
    is that you can right click on the website that you are in. After that, you will see an inspect button. If you press
    that button, then there will be a section named "Console". If you press that the you will be there right at the
    console page.</h6>
